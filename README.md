## System requirements

DendroScan was developed and tested with Matlab R2019b on both Linux (ubuntu, fedora, redhat) and Windows operation systems. DendroScan can be run with Matlab in default installation and does not require any additional Matlab libraries.

## Installation and start

To install DendroScan, clone or download all files to a folder in your work directory.

## Input/Output

  Input is in the form of flat ASCII files in '.csv' format, containing 
       a list of morphometric parameters. DendroScan was designed to
       digest tables produced by the software PARTIcle Shape ANalyzer 
       ([PARTISAN](https://doi.org/10.4401/ag-7865)) by Dürig et al. (2018).
      
  Output files according to selection in the GUI.
